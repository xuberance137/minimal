I am the founder/CTO at [Sust Global](https://www.sustglobal.com/), where we are building geospatial AI for risk modeling and climate adaptation. I am in interested in data, finance and software systems that facilitate decision making. 

Previously, I led geospatial AI products at [Planet Labs](https://www.planet.com/) (NYSE:PL), an integrated aerospace and data analytics company that operates history's largest commercial fleet of earth observation satellites. 

We are in the most exciting time to build, create impact and deliver value with geospatial AI across industries. While it has never been easier to create companies, it has never been harder to stand up new businesses with defensible moats. My career mission to leverage the power of small teams forged from collaboration across autonomous experts to have societal impact. 

I spent the early years of my career as an algorithm engineer. I am constantly seeking to operate at the efficient frontier of technical depth and application domain knowledge and operational scale. In recent years, I have led products that have scaled from concepts to customer centric proof of value to planetary scale inference in weeks and months. 

I've been an invited speaker at global industry conferences like Google Cloud Next, MLConf and leading technical conferences in the machine learning space such as CVPR (2018), ICML (2019), NeurIPS (2020) and ICLR (2023).

I invest in early stage AI, geospatial and new space ventures as an angel and LP.
